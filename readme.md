# who pays the bill
as you can see it is a program based on js which you randomly insert your friend's name and after you click the start button the program starts to choose one of the names randomly, I tried to fix all the bugs that appear. in order to insert your name correctly you have to add your name inside the input without space. 

   **thanks for all constructive feedback in advance**
